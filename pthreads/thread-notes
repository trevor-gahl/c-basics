When using pthreads it's important to make the "thread" function using a pointer system. 

ie:
void *inc_x(void *x_void_ptr)

The spawned thread requires a function pointer to be passed in since a new thread will need to know where to look for the desired function.

pthread_create() is the function which creates the new thread. 4 parameters are required to be passed in.

1: pthread_t variable.
	-> This is essentially an integer that contains the information on which thread value is being interacted with.

2: flags.
	-> For most cases this is going to be NULL which indicates to use the defaults.

3: function call.
	-> Indicates which function will be executed on the newly created thread.

4: function call arguments.
	-> Passes the arguments required for the thread function to the new thread.

pthread_join() is the function that holds the processor and waits for the child thread to finish. Requires the thread variable and an attribute value to be passed in.
